                <p>Summer is here and that means it’s potluck season. Bring on the backyard barbecues, the rooftop soirees and the outdoor dinners. Whenever I’m invited to these events I always want to bring that one dish that wows the other guests. You want to hear people whispering, “What’s in this? Who made it? How do I get the recipe?” while they shove another forkful in their mouths.
                <br /><br />
                Pasta salad is always a good choice to bring to these types of parties: It can be made ahead of time and tastes better the longer it sits. But there’s one problem ― it can be boring and flavorless.
                <br /><br />
                But good news: Making a stellar pasta salad only takes one simple ingredient you probably already have in the back of your fridge … pickle juice!
                <br /><br />
                Using the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/leftover-pickle-brine_n_578592b9e4b0867123ded70d" target="_blank">leftover brine</a> from a jar of pickles isn’t a new phenomenon: It’s been used to marinate chicken, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-strange-hangover-cures_b_5516653" target="_blank">cure hangovers</a>, add a zing to bloody marys and even <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pickle-juice-for-cramps" target="_blank">relieve cramps</a> in athletes. The juice and spices at the bottom of the jar are a delicious combination of vinegar, garlic, dill, mustard seeds, peppercorns and coriander seeds. It adds a brightness to dishes with a pop of acidity, sourness and tang. Think of it as a one-stop shop for flavor.
                <br /><br />
                In this recipe, the pickle juice cuts the richness of the mayo in a dill-heavy ranch dressing while adding a briny punch of flavor. The pasta salad also includes perfectly al dente noodles, a good measure of diced pickles, hunks of sharp cheddar cheese, fresh summer tomatoes and of course extra crispy thick-cut bacon. It’s basically all of your favorite foods combined into one dish and conveniently called a “salad.”
                <br /><br />
                The next time you’re looking to be the culinary superstar of the summer, look no further than a jar of pickles. The results will surprise you and your friends.
